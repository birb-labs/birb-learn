# Birb Learn

A free, open-source platform for learning school subjects, maintained
by [Birb Labs](https://github.com/birb-labs).

🌐 [learn.birblabs.com](https://learn.birblabs.com) · [🇧🇷 pt-BR](./README.md) ·

## What this is

Lessons, worked examples and practice tests, starting with mathematics
(Calculus — Limits), with more subjects on the way.

## Tech stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router, static export)
- Plain CSS Modules (no CSS framework)
- [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev) for internationalization
- Hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter site dev
```

The site is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm -r test
```

## Repository layout

```
apps/site/            # public site
packages/theme/        # theming system
packages/content-schema/  # content types (lessons/questions)
```

## Content

Content (subjects, topics, sections and lessons) lives in a SQLite
database managed by `packages/content-schema`, recreated from scratch
on each build from versioned migrations and a seed script — there is no
persistent database until the admin panel (sub-project 4).

```bash
pnpm --filter @birb-learn/content-schema run db:generate  # generates a new migration from the schema
pnpm --filter @birb-learn/content-schema run db:reset     # applies migrations + populates with sample data
```

The question bank (used to generate practice tests) lives in the same migrations
and SQLite database as lesson content. An additional build step (`export-questions`)
compiles each question to static HTML and generates one file per locale in
`apps/site/public/data/` (`questions.pt-BR.json`, `questions.en-US.json`, `questions.es.json`),
consumed by the practice test entirely in the browser — there is no practice test backend.

```bash
pnpm --filter site run export-questions  # generates questions.<locale>.json (one per locale) from the current database
```

Content and the question bank are managed by an internal admin panel
(`apps/admin`), hosted separately on Cloudflare (Workers + D1) and
gated by Cloudflare Access plus its own login — it's not part of the
public site or its static build. Publishing a change from the admin
panel triggers the same GitHub Actions deploy pipeline that already
existed.
